## How can I help?

Please see the [issues](https://github.com/Anizoptera/reedy-android-translations/issues) section to report any mistakes and problems.
If you'd like to contribute, please [Fork](https://help.github.com/articles/fork-a-repo/) this repository and contribute back using [pull requests](https://github.com/Anizoptera/reedy-android-translations/pulls).

Any contributions, large or small, are welcome and highly appreciated!

See the [res](https://github.com/ReedyReader/Reedy-Android-Translations/tree/master/Reedy/src/main/res) folder for localization files.

Default english language is located in the [values](https://github.com/ReedyReader/Reedy-Android-Translations/tree/master/Reedy/src/main/res/values) folder.

For any other languages and locales we need to add new folder with name like `values-<lang>`.
For example: **values-es**; **values-en-rGB**.

XML-files with texts can be copied to this new folder from default [values](https://github.com/ReedyReader/Reedy-Android-Translations/tree/master/Reedy/src/main/res/values) and then translated.

Easiest way for small contribution is to just use the **edit button** (with pencil) on the top of the file content.
